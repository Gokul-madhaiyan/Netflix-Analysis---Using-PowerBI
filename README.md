# Netflix-Analysis-Using-PowerBI
I created this Power BI dashboard to explore how Netflix content is distributed across different release dates, ratings, and show types. It also highlights where content is coming from globally. The entire project is built in Power BI using real-world data, and it's designed to uncover patterns and tell meaningful stories through visuals.

## Tools Used
- Power BI: For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation
- Dataset: Netflix content data (includes title, type, release date, rating, country, etc.)

## Key Features
- Release Trends: Shows released by day of the week and year
- Content Ratings: Breakdown of ratings like TV-MA, PG-13, etc.
- Show Types: Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
- Global Reach: Map visualization of content across 88 countries
- Summary Stats: Total shows, types, average watch list, and more
- Interactive Filters: Filter by month, year, country, and show type

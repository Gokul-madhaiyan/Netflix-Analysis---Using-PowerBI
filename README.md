# Netflix-Analysis-Using-PowerBI
I created this Power BI dashboard to explore how Netflix content is distributed across different release dates, ratings, and show types. It also highlights where content is coming from globally. The entire project is built in Power BI using real-world data, and it's designed to uncover patterns and tell meaningful stories through visuals.
